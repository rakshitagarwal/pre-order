# pre-order task project

To run this project, I suggest these steps:

## In backend folder, create .env file to set environment variable and refer .env.example for database and port

## Using mongodb for database, I suggest to install mongoose first in your PC to not get any DB related error

## go to backend in terminal and execute
### `npm install`

## now run this command
### `npm start`

## go to frontend in terminal and execute
### `npm install`

## now run this command
### `npm start`

## visit localhost:3000 in your browser
