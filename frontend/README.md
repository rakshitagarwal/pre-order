# pre-order task project

To run this project, I suggest these steps:

In backend folder, create .env file to set environment variable and refer .env.example for database and port

This project uses mongoDB, so if you are planning to use localhost URL for DB connection then install mongoose in your system.

go to backend in terminal and execute
### `npm install`

now run this command
### `npm start`

go to frontend in terminal and execute
### `npm install`

now run this command
### `npm start`
